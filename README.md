# OSMD_dynamic_regret

To run the code, run the experiments in the   <strong> Experiments.py <strong>.
To test out more scenarios, make some of your own -> add more options to the <strong> Settings.py <strong>.
After that, you can easily set up more games the same way others are run in the <strong> Experiments.py <strong>.
